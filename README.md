Whoa... just walked out of watching Jumbo and my brain's a bit like that popcorn machine we stood by — loud, messy, and spilling over with stuff. God, I think there's salt in my hair. So, the movie — it's like diving into a dream where nothing makes sense but it feels right? 

You know how sometimes the back of your neck hits that awkward spot on those seats, and suddenly a giant Ferris wheel decides to come alive? Yeah, felt almsot the same. The ferris wheel was... what was it? Alive? And Jeanne, like, she’s not just in love with it, she’s IN IT. Merging. God, the way machines and human emotions just blurred, like watercolor left in the rain.

> I think the guy next to me spilled his drink when that weird scene with all the lights hitting Jeanne happened. Neon explosion — like being inside a kaleidoscope during an earthquake. The sound! Imagine Iron Man eating nachos in a cymbal factory. Download the movie? But seeing it in a theater couldn't be beat...except for my aching spine.

Some moments were a bit, uhm, 'did-I-drop-my-popcorn-or-was-that-the-plot' kind of confusing? And yet, like there's a beauty to confusion. How the heart and bolts of something can intertwine — it’s like. Well. You ever wondered if a vending machine could fall in love? 

Sorry, keep getting distracted rethinking about why someone would fall in love with a carnival ride but it really was touching in the oddest way. People around seemed baffled but mesmerized — the whole room resonated with awkward shuffling, like we all gradually synchronized.

AND! I just remembered you asking me to watch the movie — brilliant, in a rough diamond inside a sandstorm kind of way. Like. Man, I'm still dazed by it. There were a couple of folks leaving saying they wanted to download the movie later. 

final int[] loveConnections = new int[]{1, 2, 3};
string ferrisWheelFeelings = overwhelming;
void EmotionalCircuitry()
{
	Console.WriteLine(Mechanical heartbeats sync with Jeanne?);
}

So yeah, that’s probably how I... Ah, what was I on about? Anyways, surreal but hit home, sort of like a dream you want to dive right back into while also being grateful it's over so you can breathe.
